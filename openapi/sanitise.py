"""Sanitise the live OpenAPI spec for partner-facing kit publication.

The ClawDog Calculator-Constellation REST API's live `openapi.json` is generated
by FastAPI directly from the implementation. The implementation's docstrings
carry development-internal references — phase numbers, thread numbers,
mutation IDs, internal file paths, source-of-record links to internal canon.
Those references are useful to the LodgeiT Labs engineering team but noisy to
partner developers consuming the spec to generate clients.

This script transforms the raw live spec into the partner-facing snapshot by:

1. Applying a hand-curated override table that replaces schema + path
   description fields with partner-facing copy. The overrides preserve all
   statute citations and field-usage guidance.
2. Running a regex pass that strips known internal-marker patterns from any
   description that the override table didn't cover.
3. Self-checking the output for residual leaks; exits non-zero if any of the
   known leak patterns survive.

The output uses compact UTF-8 JSON, so whitespace and escaping can change.
Review the transformed schema and regenerated clients before publishing an
updated snapshot.

This script is shipped in the kit so partners can see exactly how the snapshot
is produced — the transform is auditable. The patterns it strips are
referenced literally here because that is what makes detection work; their
presence in this script does not propagate them into the published snapshot.
