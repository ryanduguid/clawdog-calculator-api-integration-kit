# Operational Guide

> What to know before shipping integration to a real customer. Latency expectations, retry shape, error semantics, debugging cross-checks. Zero surprises in production.

## 1. Latency expectations

The ClawDog Calculator API runs on Google Cloud Run in the `australia-southeast1` (Sydney) region.

| Condition | P50 | P95 (target) |
|---|---|---|
| Warm container, single calc invoke | ~80–150 ms | ~400 ms |
| Cold-start, single calc invoke | ~2–4 s (first request) | ~6 s |
| Discovery (`GET /v1/calculators`) | ~50–100 ms (warm) | ~250 ms |
| MCP `tools/list` | ~80–150 ms (warm) | ~400 ms |
| Depreciation audit (multi-asset batch) | scales ~linear in asset count; expect ~30 ms / asset warm | depends on batch size |

**If your customer is outside the Asia-Pacific region**, add network RTT (typically 200–400 ms US/EU round-trip). For high-volume integrations against a distant region, consider proxying through a region-close cache.

**Cold-start avoidance:** Cloud Run scales to zero by default. If you have a low-volume integration that needs sub-second worst-case, send a `GET /v1/calculators` ping once every 10 minutes during business hours to keep at least one container warm. (We may add an official "keep-warm" recommendation when the service moves to general availability; until then, this is partner-discretion.)

## 2. Backpressure + retry

### The Cloud Run upstream-529 pattern

Under sustained high-cache-hit load (e.g. a partner dashboard refreshing every 5 seconds across many concurrent users), Cloud Run can saturate the upstream concurrency cap and respond with **HTTP 529** ("Site is overloaded"). The substrate is not failing — it's signalling backpressure.

**Recommended retry shape for partner clients:**

| Status | Strategy |
|---|---|
| 503, 529 | Exponential backoff with jitter. Start at 200 ms, double per retry, cap at 10 s, full jitter (Δ ∈ [0, attempt_delay]). Max 5 retries. |
| 500, 502 | Single retry after 500 ms. If still failing, surface to the user as a substrate error and file `service-issue`. |
| 504 (timeout) | Retry once with backoff. Read-only calls (`GET /v1/calculators`, `GET /v1/rates/*`) are idempotent; invoke calls (`POST /v1/calculators/*/*`) are also idempotent (deterministic Prolog over a pure input). |
| 4xx | **Do not retry.** Fix the request. |

### Idempotency

Every invocation is **deterministic** — the same input URN + period + body produces the same output, modulo substrate version changes (which would bump `info.version` in the OpenAPI spec). You can retry any 5xx safely.

### Concurrency caps

The service currently has a per-instance concurrency cap of ~10. Cloud Run scales horizontally; partner-side throttling is rarely necessary, but if you're driving more than ~100 concurrent invokes per second, consider client-side rate limiting to avoid 529 storms.

## 3. Error semantics

See [CONTRACT.md § 4](CONTRACT.md#4-error-semantics) for status-code-by-status-code detail. Operational summary:

- **4xx** = your code has a bug. Fix the request, surface the error to your customer with a meaningful translation.
- **502** = substrate resolver gap. The substrate is up but a resource it depends on isn't loadable (engine bundle missing, rate-table not present). File a `service-issue` if persistent; this is exactly the failure shape our `production-bundle gate` catches in our CI.
- **5xx other** = retry per §2.

## 4. Why our CI probes the live substrate

The kit's CI (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) runs **two gates**:

1. **Gate 1: offline example regression.** Builds the .NET example, validates the OpenAPI snapshot and runs both commands against a local fabricated HTTP service. Tests cover failures, retries, discovery, response validation and the sample's day count.
2. **Gate 2: live probe.** Runs the Python example against the public production URL with up to five retries on 5xx. Separate REST and MCP discovery probes check the required capability and JSON-RPC envelope while allowing additions. HTTP and decoding errors fail the probe.

These gates check the example's consumed fields. They do not compare the entire deployed schema with the pin, call every calculator or establish independent numerical correctness. The displayed API version comparison is informational.

**Partner recommendation:** mirror Gate 2 in your own CI. Have at least one test in your pipeline that hits the live calc-api (with appropriate timeout + retry) and asserts the response shape matches what your integration expects. If you only run hermetic tests, you'll discover contract drift in production rather than in CI.

## 5. Versioning + deploy cadence

The substrate API version is exposed at `openapi.json#/info/version`. At this kit's pin, it is `0.1.0a0` ("0.1.0 alpha 0" — pre-production alpha).

**Upstream version-bump behaviour:**

- **Patch bumps** (`0.1.0a0` → `0.1.0a1`): backward-compatible additions (new calculator URN, new optional field, new error code). Existing partner integrations continue to work.
- **Minor bumps** (`0.1.0` → `0.2.0`): potentially backward-incompatible additions (new required field, renamed endpoint). Partners should regenerate clients + re-run CI.
- **Major bumps** (`0.x` → `1.0`): public general availability + the auth landing. Partners should plan an integration audit.

To detect a substrate-version-bump, watch:

1. This kit's releases (we refresh the snapshot pin + CHANGELOG on each substrate bump).
2. The substrate's `openapi.json#/info/version` field directly (your CI can poll it).
3. The `lodgeit-labs/clawdog-calculator-api` repo's release tags.

## 6. Debugging sheet-vs-engine divergences

If you build an integration that drives calculations against the calc-api and compares results against a "known-good" reference (a customer's existing parity sheet, an existing C# tax engine, an Excel template), and a divergence surfaces — i.e. your reference says one number, our calculator returns another — there is a canonical cross-check pattern.

**The pattern (used internally during our FBT FY2026 build-out):**

1. Identify the *exact statutory inputs* of the divergent row (every field the calculator declares in its input schema).
2. Drive those *literal* inputs through a known-good reference implementation if one is available. For Australian FBT, the LodgeiT Smart-Excel-Utility C# implementation is the LodgeiT-internal reference.
3. Compare both outputs against the statutory algebra (cite the statute-of-record from CONTRACT.md § 3).
4. The result is almost always one of:
   - **The parity sheet is stale** (it was authored against an older statutory rate or an older version of the inputs). Update the sheet.
   - **Your input mapping is incorrect** (you're passing the wrong field). Fix the integration.
   - **There is a genuine substrate bug.** File `service-issue` with the literal inputs + the divergence + the statutory algebra.

In ~80% of the divergences we've worked through internally, the parity reference was stale. In the other ~20%, the input mapping was wrong. Genuine substrate bugs are rare and we want to hear about them when they happen — that's what `service-issue` is for.

## 7. Issue filing

The `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory has two issue templates:

### `integration-question.md`

Use when:

- You don't understand how to use the kit.
- The docs don't cover your use-case.
- You want to confirm a behaviour before relying on it.
- You want to suggest a doc improvement.

We respond with documentation deltas, code suggestions, or examples. Triages to ClawDog (the LodgeiT Labs autonomous engineering agent); first response typically within a working day.

### `service-issue.md`

Use when:

- You believe the substrate behaves incorrectly.
- A response is missing data you expect.
- An error response is unhelpful or incorrect.
- A calculator returns a value that disagrees with the statute-of-record algebra you've computed independently.

We confirm against the substrate, route to the calc-api repo for fix, and reply with the fix-tracking-issue URL. If the issue is reproducible, expect a fix within a sprint.

**What we need in a `service-issue`:**

- The exact URN + period URN.
- The exact request body (with any PII redacted).
- The exact response received.
- The expected response + the statutory algebra + citation.
- Repro environment (your client language, OS, kit version).

The more deterministic your repro, the faster the fix.

## 8. Privacy + data handling

The calc-api does not log request bodies in a customer-identifiable form. It logs:

- Request method + path (e.g. `POST /v1/calculators/urn:sbrm:calculator:fbt:car-operating-cost/urn:sbrm:period:fy2026`).
- Response status code.
- Latency.

It does not log:

- Request bodies (your customer's tax inputs).
- Response bodies (your customer's calculated tax positions).
- Client IP addresses beyond what Cloud Run captures for routing.

**For your customer data residency:** the substrate runs in `australia-southeast1` (Sydney). All compute happens in-region. If your customer's regulatory framework requires you to know the data path, this is the answer for the substrate side; your client-side path is your responsibility.

**If you need different residency** (EU, US, etc.) for compliance, file an `integration-question` issue with the residency requirement. We may stand up regional deployments in response to documented partner demand.

## 9. What we don't do

For absolute clarity, the substrate **does not**:

- Store any customer state. Every invocation is stateless.
- Send you alerts, emails, or webhooks. You drive integration.
- Provide a customer-facing UI. We give you the engine; you build the UI.
- Speak SOAP, XML, or any non-JSON protocol.
- Run on-premise. The substrate is cloud-hosted only at this stage.
